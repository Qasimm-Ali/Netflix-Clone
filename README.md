This is a clone of Netflix website built using React.JS as a Front-end and Tailwind css for styling and responsiveness. it doesn't have all the features of Netflix website., but it's a similar version of Netflix with my own design touch, showing my abilities in React.JS to build something advanced like Netflix. It contains the home page, sign-in page, sign-up page and browse page
